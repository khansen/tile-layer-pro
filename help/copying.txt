    Copying tiles

    You can copy tiles from a ROM to another position in the same ROM, or from
    one ROM to another. The format of the destination ROM does not have to be
    the same as the source; Tile Layer Pro will automagically take care of the
    necessary conversion. For example, if you copy tiles from a NES ROM to a
    GameBoy ROM, the tiles will be encoded in GameBoy format, if you copy them
    to a SNES ROM, they will be encoded in SNES format, and so on.

    There are two ways to copy tiles: One tile at a time, or multiple tiles at
    a time.

    Copying one tile at a time:

    Drag & drop. Click on the tile you wish to copy with the left mouse button,
    then drag it to the desired position, either in the same ROM or in another
    open ROM window. Drop the tile to encode it at that position.

    You can only undo the last tiledrop that was performed, so be careful.

    Copying multiple tiles at a time:

    Use the right mouse button to select a tile grid to copy, by first clicking
    the mouse in the upper left corner of the grid, then drag it to the desired
    dimensions. The current selection is easily seen, as the colors of that area
    will be inverted. Next, copy the selection with Ctrl+C (or by selecting Copy
    from the Edit menu), then paste it in the desired window with Ctrl+V (Edit->Paste).
    The image will be placed in the upper left corner of the window, and you can
    now use the mouse to move it to the desired position (the mouse cursor will
    change when you hold it over the image, indicating that it can be moved). To
    encode the image, click the mouse outside of it. If you decide you don't want
    to paste it after all, press ESC or DEL. (There is NO undo for the paste
    operation!!)

    Note about converting tile data between various formats: While there's no
    problem converting a tile from a format with higher bitdepth than the
    destination format, going the other will result in a loss of color data.
    F.ex., since SNES tiles are 4-bit while NES tiles are only 2-bit, copying
    a SNES tile to a NES ROM results in the upper 2 bits of color info in the
    tile being lost.
