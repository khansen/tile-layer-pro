    Tile Editing

    The integrated Tile Editor looks like so:

    Editing a tile is easy. Just click on it with the left mouse button, and a
    zoomed version will pop up the Tile Editor. In the editor window, use the
    left mouse button to draw with the current foreground color, right button
    to draw with the background color. You can also flip the tile horizontally and
    vertically, and rotate it 90 degrees clockwise. To prevent you from messing
    up, there's a handy Undo button that can undo the last 64 tile operations,
    for EACH open ROM.

    You can also shift a tile one pixel in any direction, by holding down shift
    and then pressing the arrow key that points in the desired direction.

    When multiple files are open, the Tile Editor remembers which tile you edited
    last in each ROM. So when you switch between ROMs, the editor will be reloaded
    with the last tile that was edited in the newly selected ROM.
