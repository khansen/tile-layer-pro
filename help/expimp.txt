    Exporting and importing bitmaps

    The ability to export and import bitmaps means that you can edit the ROM
    graphics in a normal paint program, then bring them back to the ROM and
    encode them in the desired tile format. Currently only 8-bit uncompressed
    Windows .BMPs are supported.

    To export a bitmap, first select the area of the current ROM window you
    wish to save. This is done by using the right mouse button to size the
    desired tile grid. Then select Edit->Export Bitmap.

    To import a bitmap, select Edit->Import Bitmap, and load the bitmap you
    wish to import. The bitmap will be positioned in the upper left corner of
    the current ROM window, and you can use the mouse to move it to the
    desired position.
