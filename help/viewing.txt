    Viewing

    Following are the keys that affect how you view a ROM. In addition to these,
    the window has scrollbar functionality, but with it you can't finetune the
    offset quite as well as you can with the keyboard. (Graphics aren't always
    aligned on 8, 16 or 32-byte boundaries.)

    Up/Down:        Row up/down.
    Left/Right:     Tile left/right.
    Minus/Plus:     Byte left/right.
    Page Up:        Guess.
    Page Down:      Guess again.
    Home:           Beginning of ROM (offset 0).
    End:            End of ROM.

    Also, Ctrl+Left/Right does the same as Minus/Plus, in case you don't want
    to stretch all the way to those keys.

    Resizing a window

    By default, the ROM window has 16 rows of 16 columns, but you might want to
    view a file in a different resolution. You can resize the window either with
    the mouse, or with the keyboard. To resize with the keyboard, hold down shift,
    then press the arrow key in the direction you want to resize it in.

    Changing the tile format

    When you load a ROM, Tile Layer Pro will decide the default tile format
    based on the extension of the filename. But some ROMs store graphics in
    several different formats (f.ex., a lot of SNES games store 2BPP-graphics
    in GameBoy format to save space), so there's an option to switch to a
    different tile format at any time.

    This can be done either from the View->Format menu, where there is a list
    of all supported tile formats, or by pressing 1. Pressing 1 will cycle
    through all the available formats. The currently selected format and its
    bitdepth is indicated in the statusbar.
